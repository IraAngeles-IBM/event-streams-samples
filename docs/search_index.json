Event Streams for IBM Cloud is a scalable, distributed, high throughput message bus to unite your on-premise and off-premise cloud technologies. You can wire micro-services together using open protocols, connect stream data to analytics to realize powerful insight and feed event data to multiple applications to react in real time.\nThis repository is for samples which interact with the Event Streams for IBM Cloud service. \nCurrently, there are samples for the Kafka and MQ Light APIs.\nInformation and instructions regarding the use of these samples can be found in their respective directories.\nAim of the Samples\nThe aim of the samples is to help you get started with Event Streams for IBM Cloud within minutes. They are not production-ready applications but should give you useful pointers at how to build, package and deploy applications as well as how to make basic API calls against us with error handling. We did all the heavy lifting so you can focus on developing exciting code with value!\nProvisioning your Event Streams for IBM Cloud Cluster\nIn order to provision an Event Streams for IBM Cloud cluster, please visit the IBM Cloud® catalog. Please also familiarise yourself with Event Streams for IBM Cloud and Apache Kafka basics and terminology. Our documentation is a good starting point.\nPricing plans\nIBM Event Streams can be provisioned on IBM Cloud® in various pricing plans. Please refer to our documentation to help choose a plan that works for you.\nImportant Note: Provisioning an Event Streams service in IBM Cloud® incurs a fee. Please review pricing before provisioning. The samples in this repository will create topic(s) on your behalf - creating a topic might also incur a fee. For more information, please consult the IBM Cloud® documentation if necessary.\nConnecting to your Event Streams for IBM Cloud Cluster\nIn each sample, we demonstrate a single connection path for both our Classic and Standard/Enterprise plans respectively. The aim was to get you started quickly. However your client's needs might be different. Therefore we wrote a guide that discusses credential generation in detail and showing you all possible ways of doing this.\nOur APIs and Sample Applications\nKafka API (recommended):\n\nkafka-java-console-sample : Sample Java console application using the Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka API\nkafka-java-liberty-sample : Sample IBM Websphere Liberty profile application using the Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka API\nkafka-nodejs-console-sample : Sample Node.js console application using the Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka API\nkafka-python-console-sample : Sample Python console application using the Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka API\nkafka-connect : Sample Docker image with Kafka Connect\nkafka-mirrormaker : Sample Docker image with Kafka Mirror Maker\n\nSpring Kafka:\n\nspring kafka tutorial : Tutorial to quickly get you up and running using IBM Event Streams. \nspring-kafka : Sample app to connect to Event Streams using Spring Kafka\n\nGet Further Assistance\nIf you have any issues, just ask us a question (tagged with ibm-eventstreams) on StackOverflow.com.\nFor more information regarding IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud, view the documentation on IBM Cloud.\n"},"kafka-nodejs-console-sample/docs/Local.html":{"url":"kafka-nodejs-console-sample/docs/Local.html","title":"Local setup","keywords":"","body":"IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud Kafka Node.js console sample application: Local Development guide\nAs pushing the application into IBM Cloud® does not require you to build the application locally, this guide is here to guide you through the process, should you wish to build the application locally.\nWe will not discuss establishing a connection from your laptop to Event Streams for IBM Cloud.
