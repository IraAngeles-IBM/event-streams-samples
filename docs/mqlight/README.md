## Using the MQ Light API in Event Streams for IBM Cloud
The MQ Light API provides a simple AMQP-based messaging interface for Javaâ„¢, Node.js, Python, and Ruby. The API is provided for backward compatibility with the earlier MQ Light service. The MQ Light API is available as part of the Classic plan only. For more information, please refer to our [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-mql_using#mql_using).
